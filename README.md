## About

This is my Week 2 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

This is a basic tool to scale the world to the user height.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Start C# Script and set up variables to be used in world scaling.

*10/31 4:35PM* Fixed collider around the button on the canvas. Removed the
teleportation points because of a `NullReferenceException` that caused them to not work.

## About

This is my Week 2 portfolio project created for the XR Bootcamp Prototyping course.

This is a basic tool to scale the world to the user height.


## Todo

**Current Goal:** Make sure the canvas works in VR and the player/scene layout
is set up correctly.

*10/31 3:52PM* Added essential assets such as ProBuilder and SteamVR in order to
create basic layout. Added Canvas with a Generate button and 2 teleportation spots for the user.
